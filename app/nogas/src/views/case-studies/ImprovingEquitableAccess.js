                States has skyrocketed from 17 percent to more than 93 percent. 
                In the suburbs, where less than five percent of the U.S. workforce 
                uses public transit to get to work, the configuration of the built 
                environment is designed to prioritize cars. These car-centric communities 
                create distinct burdens for an increasing percentage of the suburban 
                population who are elderly, disabled, or otherwise unable to drive. 
                And the emphasis on monofunctional vehicular infrastructure often 
                makes it difficult for pedestrians and those using existing micromobililty 
                offerings, such as bicycles and scooters.`,
                `In the near-term, the proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) may offer 
                a path forward for mobility-challenged people, enabling them to use vehicular
                infrastructure without driving a car. Eventually, widespread adoption of 
                autonomous transportation systems and new land use patterns that include 
                expanded micromobility options could pave the way for radically new suburban
