            `Since 1925, the number of car-owning households in the United States has skyrocketed from 17
percent to more than 93 percent. In the suburbs, where less than five percent of the U.S.
workforce uses public transit to get to work, the configuration of the built environment is
designed to prioritize cars. These car-centric communities create distinct burdens for an
increasing percentage of the suburban population who are elderly, disabled, or otherwise
unable to drive. And the emphasis on monofunctional vehicular infrastructure often makes it
difficult for pedestrians and those using existing micromobililty offerings, such as bicycles and
scooters.`,
            `In the near-term, the proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) may offer a path forward for
mobility-challenged people, enabling them to use vehicular infrastructure without driving a car.
Eventually, widespread adoption of autonomous transportation systems and new land use
patterns that include expanded micromobility options could pave the way for radically new
suburban configurations that prioritize equitable mobility for all. `,
