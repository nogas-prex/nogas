            `Since 1925, the number of car-owning households in the United States has skyrocketed from 17
            percent to more than 91.6 percent.[1] In the suburbs, where less than five percent of the U.S.
            workforce uses public transit to get to work, the configuration of the built environment is
            designed to prioritize cars.[2] These car-centric communities create distinct burdens for an
            increasing percentage of the suburban population who are elderly, disabled, or otherwise
            unable to drive.[3] And the emphasis on monofunctional vehicular infrastructure often makes it
            difficult for pedestrians and those using existing micromobililty offerings, such as bicycles and
            scooters.[4]`,
            `In the near-term, the proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) may offer a path forward for
            mobility-challenged people, enabling them to use vehicular infrastructure without driving a car.
            Eventually, widespread adoption of autonomous transportation systems and new land use
            patterns that include expanded micromobility options could pave the way for radically new
            suburban configurations that prioritize equitable mobility for all. `,
