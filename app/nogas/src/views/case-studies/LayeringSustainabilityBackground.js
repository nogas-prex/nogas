effects of climate change. In 2021, more than 80 percent of Americans
experienced at least one heat wave, which were the primary cause of more than
1,300 deaths that year in the U.S. Along with these extreme heat events,
drought and wildfire are threatening millions of lives and properties.
Meanwhile, increased precipitation intensity, along with sea-level rise, is
causing a sustained increase in billion-dollar flood events each decade.`,

becoming hotter and hotter. The impervious surfaces, especially road surfaces
paved by material with low solar reflectance rate (or albedo), have made a huge
contribution to this condition. Some research has shown that the air
temperature on a paved street can be 40 to 60 degrees warmer than nearby air
temperatures. A lack of tree canopy can worsen these conditions. As shown in
the thermal image at right, the street without shade can be 20 degrees warmer
