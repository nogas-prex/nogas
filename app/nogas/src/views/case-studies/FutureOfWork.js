climate change such as extreme heat, drought, flooding, and wildfire. Meanwhile, more

accelerates the urbanization rate in these areas. As the result of urbanization processes

exacerbates the extreme heat, urban flooding, and other climate disasters. Hence, a

          `In the near term, a more integrative approach to zoning
        can help redistribute smaller commercial clusters
        and increased park space throughout residential
        neighborhoods, allowing a finer-grained suburban
        fabric to emerge that caters more explicitly to a mix of
        pedestrians, and micro-transit users. This atomization
        of residential islands, when applied to greenfield
        development, can facilitate a significant reduction of
        long-distance vehicular trips by clustering land uses
        together within a much smaller walk shed. It can also
        increase the environmental benefits of heterogeneity
        by expanding access to public open space areas, which
        has proven to be one of the most valuable neighborhood
        public health assets since the beginning of the
        COVID-19 pandemic.`,
          `A transition from traditional car-based urbanism to
        autonomous, on-demand mobility paradigms will further
        support a shift towards finer-grained land use planning
        by leveraging new micro-mobility options to grant users
        greater access to services and amenities.`,
